This will reduce the dataset size which is good if we want reduced computation effort and thus, will lead to faster computation but at the same time it will lead to loss of information and can give overly optimistic performance which we might not observe on test set.  \n",

This will increase dataset's size which will lead to more computational effort but will preserve information unlike undersampling. Duplicates are generated within minority class and this can lead to overfitting.  \n",

This is the best way to upsample as duplication is not present but points are added along straight lines in between existing data points and this can lead to addition of artificial patterns. \n",

In a case like this of frauds and scams, we want to primarily focus on predicting fraud cases as best as possible and even if some genuine cases(as long as its not too much above some threshold) are predicted to be as fraud we should be okay with it as the credit card issuer can provide tighter verification to user in these cases.

But these are two metrics, how can we use two metrics to properly compare several models? That's why measures which combine these precision and recall into one measure are used for model comparison. Once the final model in decided based on this summarization measure, we can adjust the threshold on the soft probability to adjust precision and recall levels of the model. If then we are able to achieve precision and recall above our business criterias, we can go forward to deploying our model otherwise we go back to the drawing board.  \n",

    "The model performance has improved considerably compared to when the transformations were present. The transformation was done from the persepective that even extreme points should have similar weightage when it comes to training so that the algorithm can perform better throughout the range of these predictor features but this increase in performance implies that these extreme points on which when we focussed more lead to poorer performance overall, this means that these variables could have outliers which don't follow similar pattern as majority of data points. Also, our model is quite simple and linear in nature. Thus, if the patterns become non-linear near these extreme points then our model would not be able to model it appropriately, this means that we might need more complex models to do so. Thus, I should try more complex model like decision tree first, before we jump to more conclusions."

One thing that can be tried here is PCA which maybe help in the case that the decision boundaries are linear but may not for when non-linearity comes into decision boundaries. Lets try PCA as well.

    "This should correspond to the x[24] feature that we saw in the decision tree and we can see the scaling coefficients of our predictor features which were used to linearly combine them to yield x[24]. If we had standard scaling before PCA then these coefficients would have directly meant that these coefficients highlight feature importances but the case is not so as whats going into the PCA are features which are on different scale. But we can somewhat compare V1 to V28 as they have similar scale but time and amount are on totally different scales. Maybe one option could be to add one standard scaler before PCA as well or we could just divide the coefficients by standard deviation of each variable after column transformation, then these scaled coefficients should correspond to feature importance."

It doesn't matter if the points are far or close to decision boundaries, the probaility assigned will be same.
