If I was to undersample majority class all the way to same size as minority class then that will be too much loss of information.

This means that even noisy points of fraudulent class will get attention and it might overfit a bit too much on the minority class i.e. it might perform very well on minority class but poorer on majority class. In a case like this of frauds and scams we want to primarily focus on predicting fraud cases as best as possible and even if some genuine cases(as long as its not too much above some threshold) are predicted to be as fraud we should be okay with it as the credi card issuer can provide tighter verification to user in these cases.

But these are two metrics, how can we use two metrics to properly compare several models? That's why measures which combine these precision and recall into one measure are used for model comparison. Once the final model in decided based on this summarization measure, we can adjust the threshold on the soft probability to adjust precision and recall levels of the model. If then we are able to achieve precision and recall above our business criterias, we can go forward to deploying our model otherwise we go back to the drawing board.  \n",

Does it mean that using ADASYN has introduced artificial noise thus making the patterns complexer? Because if data has become more complex and model is simpler that would lead to underfitting. Maybe we can also play with parameters of ADASYN and hope things change but I won't try this here. Rather I want to try SMOTE."

    "The model performance has improved compared to when the transformations were performed. The transformation was done from the persepective that even extreme points should have similar weightage when it comes to training so that the algorithm can perform better throughout the range of these predictor features but this increase in performance implies that these extreme points on which when we focussed more lead to poorer performance overall, this means that these points could actually be outliers which don't follow similar pattern as majority of data points. Also, our model is quite simple and linear in nature. Thus, if the patterns become non-linear near these rextreme points then our model would not be able to model it appropriately, this means that we might need more complex models. Thus, I should try more complex model like decision tree first before we jump to more conclusions."

One thing that can be tried here is PCA which maybe help in the case that the decision boundaries are linear but not for when non-linearity comes in non-linear situations. Lets try PCA as well.
